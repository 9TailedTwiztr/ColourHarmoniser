    User Interface: The game's interface consists of a few primary elements:
        A color square with adjustable RGB sliders.
        A target color square.
        RGB value displays for both the color square and the target color.
        A score counter.
        A timer.

    Game Rules:
        The target color square displays a random RGB color at the start.
        The player can use three sliders (one for each RGB component) to adjust the color of the color square.
        The player's goal is to match the color square's color to the target color as closely as possible.
        A score is awarded based on how well the colors match. A perfect match earns the highest score.
        The player has a limited amount of time to make adjustments.

    Scoring:
        The closer the color square matches the target color, the higher the score.
        Scoring can be based on the difference between the RGB values of the color square and the target color.

    Time Limit:
        The player has a set time limit (e.g., 60 seconds) to complete as many color harmonizations as possible.
        The timer counts down, and the game ends when the time runs out.

    Winning:
        The player's performance is evaluated based on the total score achieved within the time limit.
        After the game ends, the player can see their final score and share it on social media if desired.
